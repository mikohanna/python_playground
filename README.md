# python_playground üêç

This repository contains small Python exercises and practice tasks I've completed during my studies, personal learning or just-for-fun. The goal is to reinforce fundamental programming concepts and explore Python in a hands-on way.

## Contents
- `bmi_calculator.py`: A simple script that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight. It categorizes the result (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obesity classes) and provides a suggestion on how much weight to gain or lose to reach a healthy range.
- `hannanum.py`: There's a certain, mysterious natural number which has this magical attribute: one of its digits raised to the power of the sum of its digits equals the number itself. I named it (humbly) after me üòÅ. The scripts calculates this number. It also includes a function to find the ‚Äúreverse Hanna numbers,‚Äù where the roles of base and exponent are reversed.
- `hun_nums.py`: Converts numbers to their Hungarian word representations.
- `roman.py`: Converts integers to Roman numerals and vice versa.

## Notes

These scripts are simple practice exercises and may not represent production-level code. They serve as a reflection of my learning process and areas of interest in Python programming.

As I continue to learn, I plan to expand this repository with more exercises and projects.

Feel free to explore!
